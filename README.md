# Spotify SQL Project
![](https://github.com/mina407/Spotify/blob/main/spotify_logo.jpg)

## Overview
This project involves analyzing a Spotify dataset with various attributes about tracks, albums, and artists using SQL. It covers an end-to-end process of normalizing a denormalized dataset, performing SQL queries of varying complexity (easy, medium, and advanced), and optimizing query performance. The primary goals of the project are to practice advanced SQL skills and generate valuable insights from the dataset.

```sql
-- create table
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS spotify;
CREATE TABLE spotify (
    artist VARCHAR(255),
    track VARCHAR(255),
    album VARCHAR(255),
    album_type VARCHAR(50),
    danceability FLOAT,
    energy FLOAT,
    loudness FLOAT,
    speechiness FLOAT,
    acousticness FLOAT,
    instrumentalness FLOAT,
    liveness FLOAT,
    valence FLOAT,
    tempo FLOAT,
    duration_min FLOAT,
    title VARCHAR(255),
    channel VARCHAR(255),
    views FLOAT,
    likes BIGINT,
    comments BIGINT,
    licensed BOOLEAN,
    official_video BOOLEAN,
    stream BIGINT,
    energy_liveness FLOAT,
    most_played_on VARCHAR(50)
);
```

## Project Steps

#### 1. Data Exploration
Before diving into SQL, itâ€™s important to understand the dataset thoroughly. The dataset contains attributes such as:

* Artist: The performer of the track.
* `Track`: The name of the song.
* `Album`: The album to which the track belongs.
* `Album_type`: The type of album (e.g., single or album).
* Various metrics such as danceability, energy, loudness, tempo, and more.
#### 2. Querying the Data

### EDA
```sql
-- Number of Rows 
select count(*) from spotify ;

-- How many artist ?
select count(distinct artist) from spotify ;

-- How many album ?
select count(distinct album) from spotify;

-- Kind Of Album
select distinct album_type from spotify ;

-- Min and Max Duration 
select * 
from (select max(duration_min) from spotify) as max_duration 
cross join(select min(duration_min) from spotify) as min_duration ;

-- findings 
-- min value of duration is 0 let's check those songs
select * from spotify
where duration_min = 0 ;
-- There are tow song have 0 duration we need to delete those songs
DELETE from spotify
where duration_min = 0;

-- How many Channel ? 
select distinct channel from spotify ;

-- most_played_on apps
select distinct most_played_on from spotify ;
```
### Data Analysis

* Retrieve the names of all tracks that have more than 1 billion streams.
```sql
select * from spotify 
where stream > 1000000000 ; 
```
-- List all albums along with their respective artists.

select distinct album , artist 
from spotify 
order by 1;

-- Get the total number of comments for tracks where licensed = TRUE.

select distinct licensed from spotify ;

select sum(comments) as total_number
from spotify 
where licensed = 'true' ; 

-- Find all tracks that belong to the album type single.

select track from spotify 
where album_type ilike 'single'

-- Count the total number of tracks by each artist.

select artist , count(track) as number_tracks
from spotify 
group by artist
order by 2 desc;

-- Calculate the average danceability of tracks in each album.
select 
	album ,
	avg(danceability) as avg_danceability
from spotify
group by 1
order by 2 desc;

-- Find the top 5 tracks with the highest energy values.
select  track , 
	max(energy)
from spotify
group by track
order by 2 desc
limit 5 ;

-- List all tracks along with their views and likes where official_video = TRUE.
select 
	track ,
	sum(views) as total_views ,
	sum(likes) as total_likes
from spotify
where official_video = 'true'
group by track 
order by total_views desc;

-- For each album, calculate the total views of all associated tracks.
select 
	album ,
	track ,
	sum(views) as total_views
from spotify 
group by 1,2
order by total_views desc;

-- Retrieve the track names that have been streamed on Spotify more than YouTube.
select * from
			(select 
				track ,
				COALESCE(sum(case when most_played_on = 'Youtube' then stream end) , 0) as streamed_on_youtube ,
				coalesce(sum(case when most_played_on = 'Spotify' then stream end), 0) as streamed_on_spotify
			from spotify
			GROUP by 1 ) as temp_
where streamed_on_spotify > streamed_on_youtube
and streamed_on_youtube <> 0

-- Find the top 3 most-viewed tracks for each artist using window functions.
-- 1 i need to find the total views for each artist and track to do this i wil use group by to combine them and find total views
-- 2 i use window function to give number for each atrist based on total_views
select * from 
		(select artist , 
				track ,
				sum(views) as total_views ,
				dense_rank() over(partition by artist order by sum(views) desc) as rnk
		from spotify 
		group by artist , track 
		) as temp_
where rnk <=3 ; 

-- Write a query to find tracks where the liveness score is above the average.
select track ,
		artist ,
		liveness
from spotify
where liveness > (select avg(liveness) from spotify);

-- Use a WITH clause to calculate the difference between the highest and lowest energy values for tracks in each album.
with cte
as
	(select album ,
		max(energy) as highest ,
		min(energy) as lowest
	from spotify
	GROUP by album  
	)
select * ,
	(highest - lowest) as difference
from cte
order by difference desc;
